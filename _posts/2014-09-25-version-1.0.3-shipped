Version 1.0.3 of the Multisite Language Switcher shipped today

I shipped version 1.0.2 too quickly but there were some urgent fixes in:

* Bugfix: term links were damaged when term_base option were used
* Bugfix: en_GB & en_US both displayed as 'English' in Settings > MLS >Blog & Admin language
* Enhancement: Filter 'msls_meta_box_render_input_button' introduced

The changes in version 1.0.3 instead are:

* Bugfix: alternate hreflang for the current blog was empty
*Enhancement: Filter 'msls_options_get_flag_icon' introduced
* Enhancement: Shortcode [sc_msls] added
